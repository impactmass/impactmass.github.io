It's important to always put people first. [Even when writing software].

I've worked with software developers who forgets this. Heck, I forget it sometimes too.

Some developers write code (software) for machines first. They forget it's humans that maintain code over time. This reason is most times a huge contributor to why some programmers [remain mediocre].

The amount of energy, friction, and time lost for not having this as a principle is huge, both as an individual developer and as a software team.

Always remember this.
