Caring is important. 

When you care, you put in that extra touch. It's what makes one picky about choices. It's what makes one write meaningful commit messages, even on a solo project. It's what makes one follow standards. It's what makes one create standards.

It's what makes one think twice about a proposed solution. It's what makes on review one's work for the second time after the third. It's what makes one think about others on the team.

Maybe you won't call it caring. But whatever name you pick, it's important.
