I just finished Steve Jobs' biography last weekend, and I knew I had to share some things that I found interesting from the book.

# People


> “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” - Jim Rohn

Yeah. I've heard that many times before, but it was very real all through the book. Steve always made sure he surrounds himself with the right (A+) people. Early on, he went around picking all the brightest people at Apple and then he put them together as a team to build the Macintosh computer.

Also when starting NeXT, he enlisted some of the best people he had worked with in the past to work on his next generation computer idea. Same with Pixar.

# Passion (Focus/Persistence)

> Passion is one great force that unleashes creativity, because if you're passionate about something, then you're more willing to take risks. -Yo-Yo Ma

Steve has a burning desire to create things he believes should exist. Immediately he saw the primordium of what could become a personal computer with Wozniak, he became obsessed with creating it for people.

Once he saw the early forms of a Graphical User Interface at Xerox PARC, he wanted to make a computer with GUI. Also, his believe that tablet computing done right should not involve a stylus, drove him to take on the challenge of making a the iPad.

# Vision

Closely tied to passion is vision: Ability to see the potential or possibilities of what can be produced from something. Steve saw the potential impact of having a personal computer with a GUI in homes and offices.

He saw the immense impact that a high-performance machine with an easy to use interface will have on research in colleges. This vision drove him to build one (NeXT).


# Connecting

I’m sure there’ll certainly be a better word to capture this point.

When Jobs became interested in the idea of having a thousand songs in one’s pocket and started pushing for a portable music player, Jon Rubinstein who works closely with him told him that the necessary components were not available yet.

One major block to this achievement is storage disk. There wasn't any physically small storage disk that could hold that many songs and fit into the iPod design.

On a visit to Japan, Rubinstein saw some Toshiba engineers show a storage disk that they’ve been working on that can store up to 5GB of data. Immediately, it clicked to him how useful this can be.

Sometimes a conversation with someone or a sight can make us see what we thought couldn’t be achieved yet.

Among many other things, these four themes stood out in my journey through the book.
