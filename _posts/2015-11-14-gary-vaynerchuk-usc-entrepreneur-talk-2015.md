*VOW (Video of the Week) : A weekly series where I highlight a video I liked.*

#### Snippet:

> “If there is anything I can do that would be awesome for you guys [...] I'd create a test or a drug that allow people to become self aware. The number one thing that I can tell you [...] is, I think everybody lies to themselves.
You need to bet on your strengths and don't give a f**k about what you suck at.
” - Gary Vaynerchuk
