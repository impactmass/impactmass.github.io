It seems like just yesterday Andela was recruiting for our first class of developers. In fact exactly a year ago today we were using used chairs and tables in Ikoyi for our first bootcamp.

Today over 15000 young people have applied to be Andela Fellows, over 250 have attended our bootcamp which is one of the best educational experiences in the country right now and we are inching towards 100 Andela fellows!

Exciting times! Andela is now recruiting our TENTH class of fellows. Do you have a cousin, a niece, a friend, a child who is passionate about computers and would love to learn to code? Please tell them to put down that NIIT form and visit apply.andela.co.

Over the next four years Andela will pay them to train them to become world class developers while they gain experience working at amazing technology companies like Microsoft, 2U and Segovia.
