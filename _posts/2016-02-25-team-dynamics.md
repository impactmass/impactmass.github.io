The morale/spirit of a team is determined by it's individual members. That flow can be hard to keep or recreate when a new member joins. That's why [recruitment can be hard] sometimes.

If someone joins, it takes a lot of effort to make them imbibe the current spirit of the team. And sometimes, they might not. What's even more important is the bit they add to the team spirit. If they add what's contrary to the team's current spirit, then there'll be problems.

Managing such problems can be hard. It takes tact. It's better not to have the problem to start with.
