I always promise myself to read more books. By books, I don't mean technical books on software development (which is my craft). I read those when I have to learn a new language, framework or tool, and that [happens]  [quite]  [often].

I also want to read more books categorised under Personal Development, business, finance, biographies and nonfiction. This year I managed to read a few listed below.


## [Smartcuts by Shane Snow]

This book analyses how Hackers, Innovators and Icons speed up success. It profiled people and companies like David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), Elon Musk and Upworthy. 

It explains how these individuals used unique strategies to achieve more in less time. DHH created the web framework Ruby on Rails as a platform to speed up the rate at which he creates web apps. Rails helps DHH handle repetitive tasks so he can focus on the big picture. Aside from Platforms, other "smartcut" concepts are Rapid Feedback, Waves and 10x Thinking.

## [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson]

This book is the biography of the [man] behind (or was behind) Apple, NeXT, Pixar. I wrote about the book [here] [1].

## [The Start-up of You by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha]

This book is an excellent resource for career planning. It talks about how to prepare yourself to be able to enjoy career success in an ever-changing world. The authors compared building a career with building a startup. A lot of the concepts applicable to starting and running a great company also applies to building a great career.

## [Zero To One by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters]

Zero To One is my favorite read for 2015. This book talks about the ingredients needed for building the future. We build the future when we create and nurture new ideas (that takes us zero to one). Ideas that give birth to companies; Companies that create wealth.

## [The Martian by Andy Weir] 

I love this book (or novel). I read it after watching the movie produced from the book. It's hilarious and insightful. I wrote a review about it [here] [2].

## [Think Like a Freak by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner]

This book uses captivating stories to teach how to think productively, creatively and rationally. Stories that show experts going right when all the facts point to the left. Stories of government officials tackling symptoms instead of the cause of problems. It's a good read, even just for the stories.

That's all. I didn't read as much as I'd love to. Even finishing these listed books was aided by Audible. I'd get better hopefully. The lessons I picked from these books have been really helpful.
