I just finished reading The Martian. I enjoyed it. A lot. The story showed a lot of ingenuity.

If you've not heard of the book before, here's a summary of the storyline:

> Astronaut (Mark Watney) got left behind by his crew on Mars (presumed dead). He had to figure out a way to survive for about eighteen months before he got rescued. Mark was daily faced with the question: How do you survive in a place where everything tries to kill you?

The story illustrates creative problem-solving in the face of dire situations. It tries to show the challenges one can face when doing something unprecedented. In Mark's case, the situation was survival (living on Mars for more than a year).

In the book, Mark Watney faced new challenges every day and his existence depends on solving them. He went from solving one problem to the next problem. He had no one to look up to, being the first person to live that long on Mars.

It wasn't only Mark. The rest of the crew and the space agency on earth also had to tackle different challenges in saving him. 

Together they had to do things like: 

- using a solar-powered rover for long distance travel on Mars' dusty and rugged paths
- blowing up part of a space vessel to gain thrust to catch a floating MAV carrying Mark 
- creating a new space travel manoeuvre to  make a roundtrip around earth and head back to Mars
- growing potatoes on Mars' dry soil etc.

I like the book because it shows people pushing the boundary of established knowledge. They experimented and questioned preconceived notions. This is something I strive to do more of in my work as a software developer. I spotted two patterns in the book in approaching problems that I'd highlight here:

1. Going back to basics: Mark solved many problems by breaking the problem down. Then he'd assess how basic principles can be useful in solving them. Elon Musk calls this "[First Principles Reasoning]." This is approach is also true in programming. To understand and solve complex problems, one has to deconstruct it and start solving one at a time. 

2. Cross pollination: Some problems cannot be solved in isolation. A bit of knowledge from one area can be helpful in another. 
For Mark, his Botany education came in handy when figuring out how to grow crops on Mars. For the crew in the spaceship, Vogel's Chemistry background was helpful too. He made a bomb out of on-board flammables and pure oxygen to help the spaceship gain thrust. Who knows where that bit of knowledge might be useful?
Mark made this statement towards the end of his stay on Mars:
> “If I've learned one thing from my stay at Club Mars, it's that EVERYTHING can be useful.”
(emphasis mine)


Read the book if you can.
